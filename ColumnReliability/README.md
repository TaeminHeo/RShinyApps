# ColumnReliability
 
This application is designed to study how the reliability of a column is affected by two random variables: (i) the capacity of the column; and (ii) the load acting on the column. The application produces the risk assessment result based on the selected mean and variance of capacity and the correlation between load and capacity. Then, a graphical representation of capacity and load distribution is given to give students an intuitive assist for understanding the reliability concept.
