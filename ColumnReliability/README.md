# LeveeSimulation
 
This application is designed to study the Bernoulli sequence by investigating how the height of a levee affects the performance over different design lives; the return period of the levee being overtopped; and the construction cost. The application generates the levee performance of 5 consecutive years based on predefined uncertain maximum annual water height, H ~ N(12m, 3m). Students will collect several datasets by changing levee height.  Based on the collected dataset, they will learn how to optimize our plan between retrofit costs and climate change adaptation costs for a better future.
