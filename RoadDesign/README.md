# RoadDesign
 
This application is an expanded version of the lifeline application. Instead of generating an earthquake situation one-by-one, this application generates a selected number of earthquake simulations at once.  Students type the required number of simulations into the "Total number of earthquake simulation" input box.  By using this application, students get faster result.
