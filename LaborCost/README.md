# LaborCost
 
This application is designed to study random variable and probability density function by investigating how actual labor costs for construction jobs compare with labor costs predicted based on a theoretical random variable model.

This application gives the virtual experience of being a cost estimator for a small subcontractor preparing a bid for a city project. Students will get experience of thinking about how to get the project without losing money.  They will figure out why it is important to estimate labor costs as accurately as possible to make their bid competitive to get the project without risking their revenue.

This application generates random labor costs from the given theoretical probability density function.  Students will confirm that their theoretical estimation is an unbiased estimator of the modeled random variable from the collected dataset. From this activity, students are expected to learn that the theoretical estimations are their best prediction as long as their model is good. It will naturally lead them to why an accurate and robust model is most important to risk assessment.
