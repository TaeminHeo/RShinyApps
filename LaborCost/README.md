# Landfill
 
This application is designed to study conditional probability by exploring the relationship between two components of a landfill system (the lining system and a monitoring well) and how these components affect the system's performance. Based on the programed probability of two events (L: landfill liner leaks, M: monitoring well detects leakage), the application generates a simulation of the performance of the landfill system.  Students can learn how to infer conditional probabilities from the collected data using the multiplication rule of the conditional probability (or Bayes theorem).  Then, they are expected to learn the concept of a false positive and false negative.  By simulating realistic cleanup costs as well, students can learn which situation is the worst case and how we should prioritize our decisions to build a sustainable future.
